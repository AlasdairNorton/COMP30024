1. Input currently comes from the wrong source. Program currently takes
input directly from the command line as arguments, instead of from System.in.
This is simply because it is impractical to pipe data to System.in
using eclipse, and it's way faster using eclipse to test than cmd.
It's a very straightforward change to make.

2. I've used ArrayLists in several places (storing clusters in Controller,
storing positions in Cluster, finding adjacents in Position). I'm not sure
they're the most efficient data structure to use, but again, switching them
out shouldn't be too hard.
