
1. Input currently comes from the wrong source. Program currently takes
input directly from the command line as arguments, instead of from System.in.
This is simply because it is impractical to pipe data to System.in
using eclipse, and it's way faster using eclipse to test than cmd.
It's a very straightforward change to make.

2. I've used ArrayLists in several places (storing clusters in Controller,
storing positions in Cluster, finding adjacents in Position). I'm not sure
they're the most efficient data structure to use, but again, switching them
out shouldn't be too hard.

3. No error management on input- need to guard against badly formed inputs
(first character is not a number, does not contain enough positions,
contains characters other than 'B', 'W' and '-')

4. Input I'm using:
5
B B - - - 
B - B - - - 
- B - B - - - 
- - B B - - - - 
- - - - - - W - - 
- W W - - W - - 
- - W W - - - 
- - - W - - 
- - W - -

5. Currently the program: Reads a board state from command line arguments.
 	-Constructs a board object corresponding to that state (O(n^2))
	-Prints out that board (testing it's read in correctly).
	-Constructs Cluster objects for all continuous groups of same-coloured pieces.
(O(n^2) - tests every position on the board to see whether it starts a new cluster.
Forming a cluster once the starting piece is identified is O(k) where k is
the number of positions in the cluster. Upper limit on k is n^2- majority
of points on the board are one continuous group.)
	-Prints a list of the clusters identified (testing it's found them correctly)
	-For each cluster, tests whether it forms a tripod or not.
	Prints out the number of edges the cluster connects.
	O(k)- tests each point in the cluster once. In the worst case it's less
	efficient than testing each point on the edge of the board, but average case
	is better.
